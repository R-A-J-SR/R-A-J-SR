## First big project.

One of the biggest project I have been apart of was a from scratch to building a scraper for Instagram and Facebook.
My client needed data for their business and I built a scraper for Instagram first that took in keywords aka "Hashtags"
and searched grabbed the data and proceeded to save it to a file for later consumption for the business.

Next I built another scraper for Facebook that did similar, it took in keywords and searched groups for that keyword and saved it to a file.

I then followed along to the book of 

## Making Games
By: 
## Al Sweigart

I've created the first game, Memory Puzzle, where I learned a bunch and still learning to form everything into words.
Created a mainloop as most if not all games would need.
Events for mouse and keyboard.
Animation for each shaped card to reveal and unreveal.
Random Generation.

In due time everything I have learned in this project will be engrained as I continue on with this book.
